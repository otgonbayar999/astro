A Lua implementation of (some) of the cabalistic formulas from Jan Meeus, in his "Astronomical Algorithms" (1998 edition).
This code is heavily based on Bill McClain Python program, with some addenda and corrections. See http://astrolabe.sourceforge.net/ for the original Python implementation.
It was rewritten in Lua mainly for easy integration of some of the calculation to create monitors within the Ion3 window manager, that I happen to use (http://iki.fi/tuomov/ion/).
